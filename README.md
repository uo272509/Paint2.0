# Paint2.0
A simple project in which I try to replicate the functionalities of Paint, although it doesn't even come close.<br/>
The project was developed in Java using Netbeans 8.0.2 (because of university stuff...)

## Easter egg
There is a small easter egg when you open the program 😉

## Disclaimers
1. This was a university assignment, so there are many things that do not make sense (for example, I had to add an extra button, the "useless button", to meet the requirements).
2. I made everything from the icons (in SVG) to the design and animations.
